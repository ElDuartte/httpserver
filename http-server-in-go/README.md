# In this project I learned:
- Created a Go HTTP Server:
  - Used the net/http package from Goâ€™s standard library.
  - Configured a server multiplexer and multiple http.Server instances.

- Enhanced Server Functionality:
  - Implemented handling of user input through query strings, request bodies, and form data.
  - Added custom HTTP headers and "Bad Request" status codes for form validation.

- The net/http package supports handling cookies and serving HTTP traffic.

### Future:
- HTTPS


## For the Go project:
- Install Go
- Run this command to run the http server
  `go run main.go`
- To see if it's working make a =GET= request on the ports 6969 or 7070
